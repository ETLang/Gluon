# Gluon

Gluon is a tool to manage interoperable interfaces across language and DLL boundaries. Using an interface definition, written in C#, Gluon generates and maintains a C++ class that implements the equivalent interface, as well as an equivalent C# wrapper class, or C++ PIMPL wrapper, and all of the interoperability code in between. The result is a clean public-facing API, available in either C# or C++, without the need to mire the developer in API layer plumbing.

# Compatibility

Gluon is a Windows console app that depends on .Net Framework 4.5.2.
